# Assignment Name
EPAi v5 - Scope and Closures

# Session Description
This Session introduces us to the concepts of Scopes and Closures in Python
Scopes are important to understand because they allow us to manage variable usage efficiently.
More importantly, Scopes allow for optimal management of memory by utilizing only the necessary variables in the Program.
There are basically three levels of Scope in Python viz. Global, Local, and NonLocal
Global Scope refers to the availability of the variable throughout the module. 
Local Scope refers to the availability of the variable only within the enclosing structure i.e. Loop, Function, Control Structure etc.
NonLocal Scope refers to section within an enclosing structure and outside another nested one. An object is non local to the local scope of an enclosing structure, which is in turn a part of the same enclosing scope as the aforementioned object.
Next, Closures are Specialized code structures that allow a function to have persistent memory. Closures are prime examples of the usage of nonlocal scopes within python.
Along with this, we also learned that Decorators are essentially extended Closures, which can be used for a variety of requirements.
Decorater Factory allows us to allows passing multiple arguments to the underlying function.

# Assignment Description
Basically we have to write the entire assignment by ourselves!
Other than that, there are 5 things listed out as follows.
1. A closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable
2. A closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number
3. A closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts
4. Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries
Once done, upload the code to Git Hub, run actions, and then proceed to answer the quiz

# Assignment Feedback
The assignment involves creating the entirety of code repository by ourselves.
I shall follow a basic sequence of operations, slowly creating the repository, piece by piece and writing the test cases accordingly.

# Assignment Approach
1. Creating necessary files for a base repository.
2. Initializing a Git Repo for the code base.
3. Writing up details in the README.md file.
4. Writing simple test cases for validating readme files (if its found, number of titles, number of words etc.)
5. Completing rest of the requirements of the assignment.

# Quiz
Haven't completed yet, will updated once done

# Next Session
Will Update here once I check it out what's in it.

# Solutions
All functions have validations of inputs, something that is necessary to allow for mandating the type of inputs that are given to the function.
Will update more on this once I complete the Assignment.
